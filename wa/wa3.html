            Elephant Fusion Cafe and Bakery is a local family-owned restaurant in Boulder. It opened up 4 years ago. It serves Turkish and Indo-China dishes. Before it was called BOCO Cafe, but has recently changed its name. The food is DELICIOUS! Everyone in this class should patron it.<br><br>
            
            Here is a few excerpts from the restaurant's website: <br>
            
            "We are not a fast food restaurant. We provide highly quality food with high quality ingredients. Home style cooking at its finest. Our main focus is quality & taste of the food that is healthy. That is why we cook with fresh ingredients, which is mostly organic. For example, the milk and ground beef we use are both organic. Thus, our prices are generally higher than most restaurants and cafe. Everything in the menu is served all day during business hours. Plus, we don't use pork. Lastly, we prepare majority of our food with meat that is halal, hormone-free, antibiotic-free, gluten-free, and msg-free. <br>
            
            We basically make everything from scratch. For example, we make our own gyro meat. We make our own sauces. We really focus on all the ingredients being healthy, organic, fresh, and not processed.<br>
            
            Further, we are supported by our community. Thus, it's important we support our community. We donate part of our monthly sales to St. Jude Children Research Hospital. We truly believe that it is our moral duty to serve the world for better purpose. Further, we do our best to be eco-friendly, and reduce our carbon-footprint. We are not perfect but we strive everyday to take care of our community, and take steps to protect our planet. <br>
            
            Our goal is to make sure every customer leaves the restaurant happy and satisfied. We will issue a full refund if a customer is not happy or satisfied. Our customers are the true owners."<br>
